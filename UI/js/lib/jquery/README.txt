IMPORTANT!
The three scripts below should be kept in sync.


jquery-x.x.x.min.js	- used as a fallback in case the CDN version does not load for whatever reason

jquery.js	- exact copy of the above to be used as reference in all the custom scripts in order to get code completion
			- example: /// <reference path='lib/jquery/jquery.js' />

jquery-vsdoc.js	- documented version of the above (in order to get IntelliSense);
				- can be grabbed from http://appendto.com/community/jquery-vsdoc/
